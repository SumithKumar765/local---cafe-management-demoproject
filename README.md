# local---cafe-management-demoproject
In this project, I leveraged Python and web frameworks like Flask to design an open-source website for a local caf√© owner. The goal was to streamline daily sales tracking and simplify order management with an intuitive menu system. By automating calculations and reducing manual effort, this solution allows the owner to focus on other important aspects of the business, making operations smoother and more efficient.
